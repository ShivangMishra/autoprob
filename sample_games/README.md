This folder contains some sample games useful for testing autoprob. Some of these will work better than others.

Feed them into autoprob with a command line argument such as:
path=sample_games/2010-01-24-9_m138.sgf

Any file that has a suffix like m138.sgf means move 138 will be the target problem move in the game. Autoprob will use this naming convention to jump right to this move.

Some files have a comment in the root position talking about how they work with autoprob.
